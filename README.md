# docker.utils

Hello! You are likely here becuase you're in the Kim lab and you want to use
docker. There are just a few rules to follow:

* Talk to me first
* Make sure you're on the correct branch (probably plaza to use GI servers)
* Make sure you have SSH keys established on plaza, etc
* _CHANGE YOUR VARIABLES BEFORE RUNNING!!!!!!_
* Make either a branch or fork this repo before pushing any of your changes back
to the remote
